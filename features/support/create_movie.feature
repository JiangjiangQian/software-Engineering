Feature: create movie

    As a rottenpotatoes user
    So that I can properly manage the list of movies
    I want to be able to create a movie

Background: movies in database


 Given the following movies exist:
  | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
  | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas |   1977-05-25 |
  | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott |   1982-06-25 |
  | Alien        | R      |              |   1979-05-25 |
  | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas |   1971-03-11 |

Scenario: creating a new movie
    When I am on the RottenPotatos home page
    And I follow "Add new movie"
    And I fill in "Title" with "Big Data"
    And I select "R" from "Rating"
    And I select "2021" from "movie_release_date_1i"
    And I select "June" from "movie_release_date_2i" 
    And I select "8" from "movie_release_date_3i"
    And I press "Save Changes"
    Then I should see "Big Data was successfully created."
    And I should see "R"
    And I should see "2021-06-08"
